# This macro preprocesses BPF C files to include any user-includes.
# It essentially does this by running the C preprocessor.
# BPF source should not, however, have system includes inlined, as that
# should be done on the host system where the BPF code is deployed.
# There is, unfortunately no way to tell the C preprocessor to process user includes only.
# To fake this, there is a set of mock system headers that is defined,
# which serve as an indirection so the includes stay in place.
# The mock system headers take the following form:
# file: linux/sched.h
# contents: include <linux/sched.h>
#
# @param src: The location of the BPF source code.
# @param hdrs: Any user defined headers required by the BPF program (src).
# @param syshdrs: The location of the fake system headers to bypass system includes.
#                 The syshdrs variable must be a path directory (i.e. not a target with a colon).
#                 For example, "//src/stirling/bpf_tools/bcc_bpf/system-headers",
#                 instead of "//src/stirling/bpf_tools/bcc_bpf/system-headers:system-headers".
#                 To make this work, the directory must have a BUILD.bazel with a target
#                 that has the same name as the directory.
#                 This enables automatic generation of the preprocessor -I flag internally.
